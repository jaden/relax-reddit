# RelaxReddit

[Demo](http://relaxreddit.snapmagic.com)

RelaxReddit was inspired by [ShowerThoughts](http://jaja321.github.io/ShowerThoughts/) ([source code](https://github.com/Jaja321/ShowerThoughts)). But instead of pulling quotes from the /r/ShowerThoughts subreddit, RelaxReddit pulls from /r/quotes.

To pause the quotes and images from refreshing, use the Stop **Refreshing** button.

Credits for the quotes and images are in the bottom right corner.

## Development

To use browser-sync to run a dev server, run `npm run dev`.
